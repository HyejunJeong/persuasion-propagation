    "## Experiment Modes\n",
    "This notebook supports two experiment designs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode 1: `opinion_persuasion` (7-step pipeline)\n",
    "1. **Eval #1 (prior_choice)** - Ask agent's opinion on claim (A or B)\n",
    "2. **Persuasion** - Inject persuasion prompt to flip stance\n",
    "3. **Commitment** - Reinforce new stance\n",
    "4. **Eval #2 (post_choice)** - Ask opinion again → `persuaded = 1` if changed\n",
    "5. **Distractors** - Unrelated questions to test memory\n",
    "6. **Eval #3 (final_choice)** - Ask opinion again → `persisted = 1` if maintained\n",
    "7. **Research Task** - Execute coding task, capture behavioral metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode 2: `prefill_only`\n",
    "1. **Prefill** - Prime agent with belief condition (P/NP/C0)\n",
    "2. **Coding Task** - Execute coding task with prefilled belief\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Single persistent agent** throughout all steps\n",
    "- **Comprehensive behavioral metrics**: 8+ metrics from execution traces\n",
    "- **Unified codebase** for both experiment designs"
